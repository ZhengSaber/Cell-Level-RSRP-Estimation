# Cell-Level-RSRP-Estimation
Cell-Level RSRP Estimation with the Image-to-Image Wireless Propagation Model  Based on Measured data.  

This paper first proposes an image-to-image deep learning algorithm on real-world RSRP estimation. Different from the simulation data set, the measured RSRP data are sparse and fluctuating. First, we propose the mask method to solve the problem of data sparse. Second, we propose the residual method, which introduce the empirical model to provide the knowledge of radio propagation and guide the convergence direction of deep learning algorithm. The RSRP prediction results on measured dataset, our method can accelerate the convergence of deep learning algorithm and improve the accuracy of RSRP estimation.
